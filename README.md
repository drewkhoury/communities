This is a repo to show how you can build your own community using a framework.

This repo hosts our static website.

This repo has a GitHub Action that builds and publishes the site and makes it available to anyone who can access this repo. There is no infrastructure or databases, it uses https://gohugo.io/ to turn markdown into a static site (html, css, js).

You can clone this repo and run `make serve` to test a local version of it.
