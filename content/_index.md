This is a demo of our community website. You can use it as inspiration to build your very own group of communities, and build something great through collaboration!

It showcases how easy it can be to use hugo to publish a static website with no infrastructure or database to manage (and authentication with GitHub if you need it). The pipeline uses 3 musketeers to ensure a consistent experince to build and publish your site on commit, as well as fast feedback through a local environment that is identical to production and doesn't require any knowledge of how to install or run hugo itself.

This demo is a trivial example of hugos features, but remains impressive as it includes images, content managed through markdown, list pages, single pages, and the ability to group communities by custom taxonomies such as stages. Templates offer conditional logic, looping, and variable modifiers which is great for making simple changes.
